# Weather App

A simple weather app that allows users to search for the current weather and view a 7-day forecast.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OpenWeather API

### How to Run the Weather Dashboard

1. Download or clone the project to your local computer.
2. Open the project folder and launch the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. You should see the weather dashboard. Search for a city (e.g., "New York") and press Enter.
4. The current weather will be displayed along with a button to view the 7-day forecast.
5. To view the 7-day forecast, click the button: the forecast will appear at the bottom.
6. Likewise, you can search for other major cities.

#### Features

- Live weather search by city name  
- Real-time data using the OpenWeatherMap API  
- Styled using CSS with custom hover and focus effects  
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile  
- Error handling for invalid input or failed API calls

#### What I've Learned:

Building this app has deepened my understanding of working with APIs and enhanced my front-end development skills. It helped me learn how to:

- Connect a UI to a third-party API  
- Manage asynchronous JavaScript with `async/await`  
- Handle user input and display data dynamically  
- Design cleaner, more interactive UIs
